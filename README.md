# Face Detection
## Description
In this project, I have built an object detection model that is capable of detecting various objects such as faces, license plates, trees, etc. in pictures and videos. The model uses deep learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to accurately identify and locate objects in the input media.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the model:

* Python 3.8 or later
* TensorFlow 2.0 or later
* OpenCV 4.2.0 or later
* Numpy 1.19.5 or later
* Matplotlib 3.3.2 or later
* GoogleDriveDownloader 0.4 or later
* split-folders 0.5.1 or later
* albumentations 1.3.0 or later
* labelme 5.1.1 or later
* shutil 0.1.0 or later
* uuid 1.30 or later

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
To use the object detection model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/Lior-Nis/Face-Detection.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```cd Face-Detection```

3. Run the object detection script:

```python RealTimeFaceTracker.py```

the camera will open up with the detection interface.

## Examples
Here are some example outputs from the model:
